 * Wallet API
 * # Introduction Wallet API is used to create and manage Klaytn accounts and transfer transactions. If you create a Klaytn account with Wallet API, you do not need to manage private keys separately. Wallet API provides a secure wallet to keep your Klaytn account’s private keys for BApp. For more details on Wallet API, refer to our [tutorial](https://docs.klaytnapi.com/v/ko/tutorial).  Wallet API features an “Account” section for creating and managing Klaytn accounts and a “Transaction” section for transferring transactions. Wallet API creates, deletes, and monitors Klaytn accounts; updates multisig accounts; and manages the privates keys of all accounts registered to KAS.  In addition, Wallet API creates transactions and transfers them to Klaytn. They include transactions that are sent through the multisig accounts. A transaction will be automatically transferred to Klaytn if the threshold is met for the number of signatures. For more details on multisignatures, refer to [the followings](https://docs.klaytnapi.com/v/ko/tutorial).  Transactions include basic and fee delegation transactions. In particular, fee delegation transactions include global and user fee delegation transactions. In the global fee delegation transaction, Ground X’s KAS account first pays the transaction fee and charges the users later. Meanwhile, in the user fee delegation transaction, a user creates an account to pay for transaction fees when sending transactions.  Wallet API has the following functions and limitations.  | Version | Item | Description | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | 2.0 | Limitations | Support for Cypress (mainnet) and Baobab (testnet) (Service Chain not supported) | |  |  | Account management for external management keys not supported | |  |  | Multisignatures of RLP-encoded transactions not supported | |  | Account management  | Account creation, search, and deletion | |  |  | Multisignature account updates | |  | Transaction management | [Basic](https://ko.docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions/basic) Transaction Creation and Transfer | |  |  | [FeeDelegatedWithRatio](https://ko.docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions/partial-fee-delegation) Transaction Creation and Transfer | |  |  | RLP-encoded transaction \\([Legacy](https://ko.docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions/basic#txtypelegacytransaction), [Basic](https://ko.docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions/basic), [FeeDelegatedWithRatio](https://ko.docs.klaytn.com/klaytn/design/transactions/partial-fee-delegation) Transaction Creation and Transfer \\) | |  |  | Multisignature transaction management and transfer | |  | Administrator | Resource pool management (creation, pool search, deletion, and account search) |    # Error Codes  ## 400: Bad Request   | Code | Messages |   | --- | --- |   | 1061010 | data don't exist 1061510 | account has been already deleted or disabled 1061511 | account has been already deleted or enabled 1061512 | account is invalid to sign the transaction; 0xc9bFDDabf2c38396b097C8faBE9151955413995D</br>account is invalid to sign the transaction; 0x35Cc4921B17Dfa67a58B93c9F8918f823e58b77e 1061515 | the requested account must be a legacy account; if the account is multisig account, use `PUT /v2/tx/{fd|fd-user}/account` API for multisig transaction and /v2/multisig/_**_/_** APIs 1061607 | it has to start with '0x' and allows [0-9a-fA-F]; input</br>it has to start with '0x' and allows [0-9a-fA-F]; tx_id 1061608 | cannot be empty or zero value; to</br>cannot be empty or zero value; input 1061609 | it just allow Klaytn address form; to 1061615 | its value is out of range; size 1061616 | feeration must be between 1 and 99; feeRatio 1061903 | failed to decode account keys 1061905 | failed to get feepayer 1061912 | rlp value and request value are not same; feeRatio</br>rlp value and request value are not same; feePayer 1061914 | already submitted transaction.
